This small program calculuates points for a game I run in a Discord server based on the distance between the player's submission and the actual location: this program writes the points into a google sheet.

The score is calculated based on a formula that gives equal weighting to raw distance along with player placement. Players can also recieve bonus points for specific actions in the game, and if so the bonus points are calculated on top of the raw score.
